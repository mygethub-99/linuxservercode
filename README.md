# FSND Linux Server

This FSND project requires the configuration of a Linux server VM that will be used to host a catalog application. The catalog web project that is hosted on this server project is a web site that highlights a few of the Dallas Texas area restaurants.
The host server is reachable at http://ec2-52-41-58-45.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

#Database Setup

The catalog database has been setup to use a Postgresql db

Access and ownership of the catalog database has been given to user "catalog"

* catalog db password is "mydata"
* catalog db user catalog password is catalog

The catalog db tables have been setup by [Link to db setup] (https://github.com/mygethub-99/linuxservercode/blob/master/feb32015db.py)

Catalog db has been populated using [Link to db setup] (https://github.com/mygethub-99/linuxservercode/blob/master/dbpopfeb3.py)
